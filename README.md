# Python Calculator

[Python](https://www.python.org/)

At first, I created this project as a practicing file for Python, but it grew into something I never knew I'd work on. I decided to publish it on GitHub to show how people improve over time, and I hope this will also help with my dream of working at Microsoft. I am a young student and aspiring developer, passionate about learning to code and hoping to one day work with Microsoft. As of the time of publishing this, it's on version 1.6.
